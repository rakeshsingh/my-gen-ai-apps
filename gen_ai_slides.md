## Slide 1: Introduction
- **Title:** Generative AI: Transforming Business Through Intelligence
- **Subtitle:** Key Concepts and Strategic Applications
- **Presenter:** [Rakesh Singh]
- **Date:** July 21, 2025

---

## Slide 2: Agenda
- What is Generative AI?
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic AI
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Business Applications
- Implementation Strategy
- Q&A

---

## Slide 3: What is Generative AI?
- AI systems that create new content based on training data
- Can generate text, images, code, audio, and video
- Represents a paradigm shift from analytical to creative AI
- Enables automation of creative and knowledge work
- Key differentiator: Creates novel outputs rather than just analyzing existing data

---

## Slide 4: Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Foundation of modern generative AI
- Massive neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data
- Key capabilities:
  - Natural language understanding and generation
  - Context awareness and reasoning
  - Knowledge retention from training data
- Examples: GPT-4, Llama 3, Claude, Gemini

---

## Slide 5: How LLMs Work
- Built on transformer architecture
- Pre-trained on billions of documents across the internet
- Learn patterns in language through self-supervised learning
- Generate responses by predicting the most likely next words
- Limitations:
  - Knowledge cutoff dates
  - Potential for hallucinations
  - Limited reasoning capabilities

---

## Slide 6: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Enhances LLMs with real-time access to external knowledge
- Combines the power of search with generative capabilities
- Process:
  1. Query understanding
  2. Information retrieval from trusted sources
  3. Context-aware response generation
- Benefits:
  - Reduced hallucinations
  - Up-to-date information
  - Company-specific knowledge integration

---

## Slide 7: RAG Architecture
- Components:
  - Document processing pipeline
  - Vector database for semantic search
  - Embedding models for document representation
  - Retrieval mechanism
  - LLM for response generation
- Enables AI to "know what it doesn't know"
- Creates auditable AI with citations to source material

---

## Slide 8: Agentic AI
- AI systems that can take autonomous actions to achieve goals
- Combines LLMs with:
  - Planning capabilities
  - Tool usage
  - Memory systems
  - Self-improvement mechanisms
- Enables complex workflows and multi-step tasks
- Examples: AI assistants that can research, analyze, and execute tasks

---

## Slide 9: Agentic AI Capabilities
- Tool use (APIs, databases, applications)
- Multi-step reasoning and planning
- Self-correction and improvement
- Long-term memory and context management
- Autonomous decision-making within defined parameters
- Human-in-the-loop collaboration

---

## Slide 10: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Open protocol standardizing how applications provide context to LLMs
- Enables seamless communication between AI systems and external tools
- Benefits:
  - Extensibility through standardized interfaces
  - Consistent context handling across applications
  - Enhanced security and permission management
  - Improved tool integration capabilities

---

## Slide 11: Business Applications
- Customer service automation
- Content creation and marketing
- Knowledge management and internal documentation
- Product development and innovation
- Process automation and workflow optimization
- Decision support systems
- Personalized customer experiences

---

## Slide 12: Implementation Strategy
- Start with clear business objectives
- Identify high-value, low-risk use cases
- Build with privacy and security by design
- Implement human oversight and feedback loops
- Measure impact with clear KPIs
- Scale gradually based on proven success
- Continuously evaluate and improve

---

## Slide 13: Our GenAI Project
- Built using open-source tools:
  - Ollama for local LLM deployment
  - LangChain for orchestration
  - ChromaDB for vector storage
  - Streamlit for user interfaces
- Capabilities:
  - Basic chatbots
  - RAG-enhanced knowledge systems
  - Agentic tools for complex tasks
  - CLI and web interfaces

---

## Slide 14: Getting Started
- Immediate next steps:
  1. Identify priority use cases
  2. Assemble cross-functional team
  3. Develop proof of concept
  4. Establish evaluation framework
  5. Create deployment roadmap
- Timeline: 90-day initial implementation

---

## Slide 15: Key Takeaways
- GenAI represents a transformative technology for knowledge work
- LLMs provide the foundation, while RAG and agentic capabilities enhance utility
- Business value comes from augmenting human capabilities, not replacing them
- Start small, measure impact, and scale strategically
- Focus on solving real business problems, not implementing technology for its own sake
